## Story

### Insights into Correlations

1. **Strong Correlation Between Overall and Quality**: The correlation coefficient of approximately 0.826 between `overall` and `quality` indicates a strong positive relationship. This suggests that as the quality rating increases, the overall rating tends to also increase. This is expected in many media datasets, where quality directly influences the overall impression.

2. **Moderate Correlation Between Overall and Repeatability**: The correlation of about 0.513 between `overall` and `repeatability` is moderate, indicating that there is a positive relationship, but it's not as strong as the correlation with quality. This might suggest that while repeatability can influence overall ratings, it is not as critical a factor as quality.

3. **Weak Correlation Between Quality and Repeatability**: The correlation coefficient of approximately 0.312 indicates a weak relationship between `quality` and `repeatability`. This suggests that higher quality does not necessarily lead to increased repeatability, which could imply that viewers may appreciate a media piece for its quality but not feel compelled to revisit it frequently.

### PCA Results

The PCA results show that the first principal component explains approximately 76.05% of the variance in the dataset, while the second component explains an additional 18.66%. This implies that a significant portion of the dataset's variance can be captured with just two dimensions, indicating that the dimensions represented by quality and overall ratings are the most significant contributors to the variation in the data.

### Clustering Patterns

The clustering silhouette score of approximately 0.438 suggests that the clusters formed in this dataset are of moderate quality. A score closer to 1 would indicate well-separated clusters, while a score closer to 0 suggests overlapping clusters. This moderate score may indicate that there are some similarities in the data points that lead to ambiguous clustering, possibly due to overlapping characteristics of media types or ratings.

### Strategies for Improving Data Quality or Modeling

1. **Address Missing Values**: 
   - The dataset has 99 missing values in the `date` column and 262 in the `by` column. Consider strategies like imputation (e.g., filling missing dates with the average date or the mode if applicable) or removing entries with critical missing values (like missing `by` values), which might be significant for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Check for duplicates in `title` and `by` columns and remove them if necessary.
   - Standardize the `type` and `language` columns to ensure consistency (e.g., ensuring all entries are in the same case).

3. **Enhance Feature Engineering**: 
   - Create new features from existing ones. For example, consider deriving features from the `date` column (e.g., year, month, or day of the week) which may relate to overall ratings or trends over time.
   - Explore sentiment analysis on titles or descriptions (if available) to add qualitative data into
